# StructuredReservoirComputing

This respository contains notebooks and associated files for creating and analysing reservoirs with the connectivity matrix constrained by an form of exponential distance rule.
The notebook allows you to see how the procedure works.  There are currently a few dependencies that are missing, and will be updated before the IEEE IJCNN 2022 conference.  If you have any issues, feel free to contact me at peter.dominey@inserm.fr
